# 📂 Virtual File Space

An interactive **Streamlit application** that allows you to upload, process, and query files using **chunking + embeddings + Ollama-powered conversational AI**.  

With this app, you can:
- Upload multiple files (PDF, DOCX, CSV, TXT, JSON, images, etc.)
- Automatically **chunk** and embed documents for retrieval
- Save chunked text as **JSON**
- Ask natural language questions and get contextual answers
- Manage sessions with a simple and clean UI

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-file Upload**: Supports `pdf`, `docx`, `csv`, `txt`, `json`, and more  
- **Smart Chunking**: Split documents into chunks of configurable size  
- **Embeddings + Retrieval**: Uses [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/) and [FAISS](https://faiss.ai/) for semantic search  
- **Conversational Q&A**: Query your documents using an **Ollama-powered LLM**  
- **Session Management**: Clear history, save uploads, and track session inventory  
- **Download Chunks**: Export processed chunks as a JSON file
